# **Distributed Application Architecture**
In the previous chapter, we discussed advanced tips, tricks, and concepts that are useful when containerizing complex distributed applications, or when using Docker to automate sophisticated tasks.

In this chapter, we'll introduce the concept of a distributed application architecture and discuss the various patterns and best practices that are required to run a distributed application successfully. Finally, we will discuss the additional requirements that need to be fulfilled to run such an application in production.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

- [Understanding the distributed application architecture](Understanding-the-distributed-application-architecture.md)
- [Patterns and best practices](Patterns-and-best-practices.md)
- [Running in production](Running-in-production.md)

# Summary
In this chapter, we learned what a distributed application architecture is and what patterns and best practices are helpful or needed to successfully run a distributed application. Lastly, we discussed what more is needed to run such an application in production.

In the next chapter, we will dive into networking limited to a single host. We're going to discuss how containers living on the same host can communicate with each other and how external clients can access containerized applications if necessary.
