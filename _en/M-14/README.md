# Running a Containerized App in the Cloud
In the previous chapter, we learned how to deploy, monitor, and troubleshoot an application in production.

In this chapter, we will give an overview of some of the most popular ways of running containerized applications in the cloud. We will explore self-hosting and hosted solutions and discuss their pros and cons. Fully managed offerings from vendors such as Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Engine will be briefly discussed.

Here are the topics we will be discussing in this chapter:

- [Understanding Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](Understanding-Google-Kubernetes-Engine-GKE.md)
- [Exploring Microsoft's Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](ExploringMicrosoft-s-Azure-Kubernetes-Service-AKS.md)
- [Deploying and using on EKS  - Amazon Elastic Kubernets  Services (AWS)](Deploying-and-using-Docker-Enterprise-Edition.md)


# Technical requirements
We are going to use AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud in this chapter. Therefore, it is necessary to have an account for each platform. If you do not have an existing account, you can ask for a trial account for all of these cloud providers.


# Summary
In this final chapter of the book, you first got a quick introduction to how to install and use Docker's UCP, which is part of Docker's enterprise offering on AWS. Then, you learned how to create a hosted Kubernetes cluster in AKS and run the animals application on it, followed by the same for Google's own hosted Kubernetes offering, GKE.

I am honored that you selected this book, and I want to thank you for accompanying me on this journey, where we explored Docker containers and container orchestration engines. I hope that this book has served as a valuable resource on your learning journey. I wish you all the best and much success when using containers in your current and future projects.
