# Overview of popular orchestrators

There are many orchestration engines out there and in use, but there are a few clear winners. The number one spot is clearly held by Kubernetes, which reigns supreme. A distant second is Docker's own SwarmKit, followed by others such as Apache Mesos, **AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)**, or Microsoft **Azure Container Service (ACS)**.

# Kubernetes
Kubernetes was originally designed by Google and later donated to the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**. Kubernetes was modeled after Google's proprietary Borg system, which has been running containers on a super massive scale for years. Kubernetes was Google's attempt to go back to the drawing board, and completely start over and design a system that incorporates all the lessons that were learned with Borg.

Contrary to Borg, which is proprietary technology, Kubernetes was open sourced early on. This was a very wise choice by Google, since it attracted a huge number of contributors from outside of the company and, over only a couple of years, an even more massive ecosystem evolved around Kubernetes. You can rightfully say that Kubernetes is the darling of the community in the container orchestration space. No other orchestrator has been able to produce so much hype and attract so many talented people who are willing to contribute in a meaningful way to the success of the project as a contributor or an early adopter.

In that regard, Kubernetes in the container orchestration space looks to me very much like what Linux has become in the server operating system space. Linux has become the de facto standard of server operating systems. All relevant companies, such as Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Red Hat, and even Docker, have embraced Kubernetes.

And there is one thing that cannot be denied: Kubernetes was designed from the very beginning for massive scalability. After all, it was designed with Google Borg in mind.

One negative aspect that you could be voiced against Kubernetes is that it is still complex to set up and manage, at least at the time of writing. There is a significant hurdle to overcome for newcomers. The first step is steep, but once you have worked with this orchestrator for a while, it all makes sense. The overall design is carefully thought through and executed very well.

In release 1.10 of Kubernetes, whose **general availability (GA)** was in March 2018, most of the initial shortcomings compared to other orchestrators such as Docker Swarm have been eliminated. For example, security and confidentiality is now not only an afterthought, but an integral part of the system.

New features are implemented at a tremendous speed. New releases are happening every 3 months or so, more precisely, about every 100 days. Most of the new features are demand-driven, that is, companies using Kubernetes to orchestrate their mission-critical applications can voice their needs. This makes Kubernetes enterprise-ready. It would be wrong to assume that this orchestrator is only for start-ups and not for risk-averse enterprises. The contrary is the case. On what do I base this claim? Well, my claim is justified by the fact that companies such as Microsoft, Docker, and Red Hat, whose clients are mostly big enterprises, have fully embraced Kubernetes, and provide enterprise-grade support for it if it is used and integrated into their enterprise offerings.

Kubernetes supports both Linux and Windows containers.

# Docker Swarm

It is well known that Docker popularized and commoditized software containers. Docker did not invent containers, but standardized them and made them broadly available, not least by offering the free image registry—Docker Hub. Initially, Docker focused mainly on the developer and the development life cycle. However, companies that started to use and love containers soon also wanted to use them not just during the development or testing of new applications, but also to run those applications in production.

Initially, Docker had nothing to offer in that space, so other companies jumped into that vacuum and offered help to the users. But it didn't take long, and Docker recognized that there was a huge demand for a simple yet powerful orchestrator. Docker's first attempt was a product called classic swarm. It was a standalone product that enabled users to create a cluster of Docker host machines that could be used to run and scale their containerized applications in a highly available and self-healing way.

The setup of a classic Docker swarm, though, was hard. A lot of complicated manual steps were involved. Customers loved the product, but struggled with its complexity. So, Docker decided it could do better. It went back to the drawing board and came up with SwarmKit. SwarmKit was introduced at DockerCon 2016 in Seattle, and was an integral part of the newest version of the Docker engine. Yes, you got that right; SwarmKit was, and still is to this day, an integral part of the Docker engine. Thus, if you install a Docker host, you automatically have SwarmKit available with it.

SwarmKit was designed with simplicity and security in mind. The mantra was, and still is, that it has to be almost trivial to set up a swarm, and that the swarm has to be highly secure out of the box. Docker Swarm operates on the assumption of least privilege.

Installing a complete, highly available Docker swarm is literally as simple as starting with **docker swarm init** on the first node in the cluster, which becomes the so-called leader, and then **docker swarm join <join-token>** on all other nodes. **join-token** is generated by the leader during initialization. The whole process takes fewer that 5 minutes on a swarm with up to 10 nodes. If it is automated, it takes even less time.

As I already mentioned, security was top on the list of must-haves when Docker designed and developed SwarmKit. Containers provide security by relying on Linux kernel namespaces and cgroups, as well as Linux syscall whitelisting (seccomp), and the support of Linux capabilities and the **Linux security module (LSM)**. Now, on top of that, SwarmKit adds MTLS and secrets that are encrypted at rest and in transit. Furthermore, Swarm defines the so-called **container network model (CNM)**, which allows for SDNs that provide sandboxing for application services that are running on the swarm.

Docker SwarmKit supports both Linux and Windows containers.

# Apache Mesos and Marathon
Apache Mesos is an open source project, and was originally designed to make a cluster of servers or nodes look like one single big server from the outside. Mesos is software that makes the management of computer clusters simple. Users of Mesos should not have to care about individual servers, but just assume they have a gigantic pool of resources at their disposal, which corresponds to the aggregate of all the resources of all the nodes in the cluster.

Mesos, in IT terms, is already pretty old, at least compared to the other orchestrators. It was first publicly presented in 2009, but at that time, of course, it wasn't designed to run containers, since Docker didn't even exist yet. Similar to what Docker does with containers, Mesos uses Linux cgroups to isolate resources such as CPU, memory, or disk I/O for individual applications or services.

Mesos is really the underlying infrastructure for other interesting services built on top of it. From the perspective of containers specifically, Marathon is important. Marathon is a container orchestrator that runs on top of Mesos, which is able to scale to thousands of nodes.

Marathon supports multiple container runtimes, such as Docker or its own Mesos containers. It supports not only stateless, but also stateful, application services, for example, databases such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB. Similar to Kubernetes and Docker SwarmKit, it supports many of the features that were described earlier in this chapter, such as high availability, health checks, service discovery, load balancing, and location awareness, to name but a few of the most important ones.

Although Mesos and, to a certain extent, Marathon, are rather mature projects, their reach is relatively limited. It seems to be most popular in the area of big data, that is, to run data-crunching services such as Spark or Hadoop.

# Amazon ECS
If you are looking for a simple orchestrator and have already heavily bought into the AWS ecosystem, then Amazon's ECS might be the right choice for you. It is important to point out one very important limitation of ECS: if you buy into this container orchestrator, then you lock yourself into AWS. You will not be able to easily port an application that is running on ECS to another platform or cloud. 

Amazon promotes its ECS service as a highly scalable, fast container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. Next to running containers, ECS gives direct access to many other AWS services from the application services that run inside the containers. This tight and seamless integration with many popular AWS services is what makes ECS compelling for users who are looking for an easy way to get their containerized applications up and running in a robust and highly scalable environment. Amazon also provides its own private image registry.

With AWS ECS, you can use Fargate to have it fully manage the underlying infrastructure, allowing you to concentrate exclusively on deploying containerized applications, and you do not have to care about how to create and manage a cluster of nodes. ECS supports both Linux and Windows containers.

In summary, ECS is simple to use, highly scalable, and well integrated with other popular AWS services; but it is not as powerful as, say, Kubernetes or Docker SwarmKit, and it is only available on Amazon AWS.

# Microsoft ACS 
Similar to what we said about ECS, we can claim the same for Microsoft's ACS. It is a simple container orchestration service that makes sense if you are already heavily invested in the Azure ecosystem. I should say the same as I have pointed out for Amazon ECS: if you buy into ACS, then you lock yourself in to the offerings of Microsoft. It will not be easy to move your containerized applications from ACS to any other platform or cloud.

ACS is Microsoft's container service, which supports multiple orchestrators such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Mesos DC/OS. With Kubernetes becoming more and more popular, the focus of Microsoft has clearly shifted to that orchestrator. Microsoft has even rebranded its service and called it **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** in order to put the focus on Kubernetes.

AKS manages, for you, a hosted Kubernetes or Docker Swarm or DC/OS environment in Azure, so that you can concentrate on the applications that you want to deploy, and you don't have to care about configuring the infrastructure. Microsoft, in its own words, claims the following:

"**AKS makes it quick and easy to deploy and manage containerized applications without container orchestration expertise. It also eliminates the burden of ongoing operations and maintenance by provisioning, upgrading, and scaling resources on demand, without taking your applications offline.**"
